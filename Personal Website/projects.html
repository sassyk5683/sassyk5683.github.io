            <h1>Projects I have created</h1>
            <h2>Starlite</h2>

            <a href="https://starlitetsa.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Click here for a bigger experience!</a>
            <p>Starlite was created my sophomore year in high school and was used to compete in TSA 22-23, in the catergory Web Development, at the regional and state competition. It was a collaborative project consisting of a teammate and I. The prompt was to create a fake space company that provided all the details and resources to becoming an astronaunt. This is one of my favorite websites as I had a lot of fun making the website as I learned how to code new things that made the website more interactive (i.e. the color changing table).</p>
            <h2>Fire Awareness</h2>

            <p>This website was used for TSA 22-23 project. I worked on this website individually and had so much fun as I created everything on theme for my personal topic. This was my first time including videos in the background and it made the website pop even more.</p>
            <h2>Activist Toolkit Website - Help the Homeless</h2>
            <embed src="https://activisttoolkit.netlify.app/" style="width:100%; height: 35vw;">
            <a href="https://activisttoolkit.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Click here for a bigger experience!</a>
            <p>This website was created for a project at the Girls Who Code Summer Imersion Program. We were challenged as a group to create an Activist Toolkit Website in the span of about 2 days; and my group decided on the problem of homelessness. This is one of my favorites as it embodieds a cause I care for a lot.</p>
            <h2>Flooding Facts</h2>
            <embed src="https://k35h4s.wixsite.com/flooding-facts" style="width:100%; height: 40vw;">
            <a href="https://k35h4s.wixsite.com/flooding-facts" target="_blank">Click here for a bigger experience!</a>
            <p>This website was created for TSA 23-24 project. I was really into bringing awarness to natural diasters, and since Texas had recent flooding, I decided to make a website about it. I wanted to include videos and learn more ahout the effects so I did lots of research.</p>
            <h2>Oil Spills</h2>
            <embed src="https://k35h4s.wixsite.com/oilspills" style="width:100%; height: 35vw;">
            <a href="https://k35h4s.wixsite.com/oilspills" target="_blank">Click here for a bigger experience!</a>
            <p>This was my very first website I created in 7th grade. The assignment was to create a website on a natural disater and the first thought that came to mind was oil spills. This was very experimental for me as I was new to building websites and I was just messing around; letting my creativity take over.</p>
            <h2>TSA Green Energy</h2>
            <embed src="https://green-energy-tsa.netlify.app/" style="width:100%; height: 30vw;">
            <a href="https://green-energy-tsa.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Click here for a bigger experience!</a>
            <p>This website was created my junior year which was the same time I was competitng in the catergory, Web Developement, in TSA 23-24. The prompt of the website was to create an informational website on how to use green energy for homeowners. This was also a collabed website with a teammate. This website taught me patience as there was a lot of errors and challenges we had to work through.</p>
