                    <p id="favone">Roses are my favorite flowers. I know roses mostly mean romace and people tied to them are romantic but I have a different meaning. Roses to mean represent life and care. You give roses to a bunch of people in your life and it shows that whoever you give it you, you care for them. They are also just really pretty.</p>

I like to play games that have lots of goals. I am goal achiever and like to practice my self-determism while playing.</p>

                    <p id="favthree">I am a very social person. I love hanging out with friends and talking to them about anything. I think that friends are an important aspect to life because they support you and give you breaks from reality in awhile. As much as I am social, I like to have small groups of friends that I am really close to.</p>
